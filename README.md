Palette Math API:The Standard for Mathematical Color Logistics.

​Palette Math is an open-source API designed for industries where color is a logistics problem, not just an aesthetic one. By shifting from subjective RGB/HEX picking to objective HSL Mathematical Harmonization, we eliminate "Color Drift" across digital platforms and physical manufacturing.

​🚀 Why Palette Math?
​In a world where AI can generate any color, accuracy and consistency are the true moats.

Palette Math provides:
​Mathematical Certainty: All harmonies (Triadic, Complementary, Analogous) are calculated using high-precision HSL vector math.

​Infrastructure Security: While the core math is open, our hosted API provides IP/Origin Locking and mTLS for secure enterprise integration.
​Compliance Ready: Hard-coded WCAG contrast verification and proprietary brand-compliance rules.

​🛠 Tech Stack
​Language: Python 3.10+ (Flask)
​Deployment: Containerized via Docker for Google Cloud Run
